# proxygen CLI

The proxygen CLI is a dedicated command-line interface tool designed to streamline the interaction between producers and the Proxy Generator service. It provides producers with a convenient and intuitive way to deploy API instances, manage API specifications, manage secrets, and deploy them within specific environments without needing to directly interact with the API platform.

## Installation and Configuration

1. Using your favourite Python package manager, install the proxygen CLI:

   ```shell
   # UV
   uv pip install proxygen-cli
   ```
   If your favourite Python package manager fails to install the package, you can use `pip` as a fallback:
   ```shell
   # PIP
   pip install proxygen-cli
   ```

2. Confirm the installation by checking the version:

   ```shell
   proxygen --version
   ```

   If there is an error with the command, ensure that `pydantic` and all proxygen's dependencies are installed correctly.

3. Configure the CLI by running:

   ```shell
   proxygen settings set api im1-pfs-auth
   ```

4. Set up proxygen credentials and settings

   Follow the instructions in the [APIM Documentation](https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/spaces/APM/pages/804495095/Proxygen+CLI+user+guide#ProxygenCLIuserguide-Configuringsettingsandcredentials) to set up your credentials and settings.

   > [!NOTE]
   > proxygen-cli doesn't use `-h` to display help. Instead, use `--help` to see available commands and options.

5. Verify the installation by running:

   ```shell
   proxygen pytest-nhsd-apim get-token
   ```

## Secrets

Secrets used for machine access are stored in Validated Relationships Service's (VRS) AWS Prod Secrets Manager with the prefix `im1-pfs-auth/proxygen/<secret>`. As well the private key is available in GitHub Secrets under the name `PROXYGEN_PRIVATE_KEY`.
