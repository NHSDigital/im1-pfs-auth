# Proxygen CLI

The Proxygen CLI is a dedicated command-line interface tool designed to streamline the interaction between producers and the Proxy Generator service. It provides producers with a convenient and intuitive way to deploy API instances, manage API specifications, manage secrets, and deploy them within specific environments without needing to directly interact with the API platform.
