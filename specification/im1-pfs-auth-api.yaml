    ## Overview
    ![IM1 PFS Auth API High-level Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHSDigital/im1-pfs-auth/main/specification/assets/overview.drawio.svg)

    An intermediary service to allow a proxy to act on behalf of their patient, regardless of GP practice they are registered to. Use this API to authenticate a user using an NHS login issued "proxy token" and initiate a session with the appropriate supplier system based on ODS code where an online account will be matched. A successful match would return newly established IM1 session details.

    You can:

    - Authenticate a user and initiate a session with the approporiate supplier

    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have this and a valid use case before
    you go too far with your development by [contacting us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)

    You must do this before you can go live (see 'Onboarding' below).

    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:
    - we will be making breaking changes

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API supports [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis) access type with the following access modes:

    | Access mode                   | Access type            |
    |-------------------------------|------------------------|
    | Patient access                | User-restricted        |

    For more information on access modes and how to use them, see the developer [security and authorisation guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation).

    ### User-restricted access

    User-restricted access meaning an end user must be present, authenticated and authorised.

    #### Patient access mode
    If the end user is a patient then you must use this access mode.

    [Review all patient access modes](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#patient-access-mode)

    Validated Relationships Service API checks the patient is P9 verified and has a high [vector of trust](https://nhsconnect.github.io/nhslogin/vectors-of-trust/) (VOT).

    Allowed vectors of trust are:
    - `P9.Cp.Cd`
    - `P9.Cp.Ck`
    - `P9.Cm`

    ## Headers
    This API is case-insensitive when processing request headers, meaning it will accept headers regardless of the letter casing used. (e.g. X-Request-Id, x-request-id are treated the same). When sending headers back in the response, we preserve the exact casing as received in the original request.

    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing)

    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    ## Onboarding
    You must get your software onboarded before it can go live.

        ## Overview

        A user can authenticate and establish a session with GPIT supplier systems.

        This endpoint:
          - Verifies the user access token
          - Extracts the NHS number for the user, NHS number and ODS code of the patient
          - Determines which supplier system to forward requests onto
          - Transforms response

        ## Access modes

        This endpoint supports the following access modes:
        - Patient access

        ## Sandbox test scenarios

        See the postman collection for example requests.

        | Scenario               | Request                                                                                     | Response                                                    |
        | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
        | Successful request     | Valid request with forward to value of https://example.com and ods code value of A29929     | HTTP Status 201 Success response                            |

        ### Sandbox constraints
          - Headers that are not required for the scenario are not validated and are disregarded.

        Or perhaps you'd like to try out the sandbox using our 'Try it out' feature.
